Project: Optimizing Warehouse Supply Amounts for FMCG Instant Noodle Product
Objective:
To forecast the ideal product weight to dispatch from any warehouse, thereby reducing inventory costs and wastage. This optimization will be achieved by constructing a model utilizing past data.

Key Insights:

Feature Correlation: Understanding the relationship between numeric features and the target variable is crucial for effective feature selection, model building, and accurate predictions.
Selected Features: The chosen features provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the target variable, aiding in better decision-making and supply chain optimization.
Model Accuracy: The model's high accuracy in forecasting the ideal product weight demonstrates its ability to optimize warehouse supply amounts efficiently.
Methodology:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather historical data on warehouse supply, product demand, and relevant factors. Clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Create or transform features as needed to improve model performance. Consider factors like seasonality, regional trends, and product variations.
Model Selection and Training: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g.Random Forest,regression)and train it on the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics 

Reduced Inventory Costs: By forecasting optimal dispatch quantities, the project aims to minimize excess inventory and associated costs.
Reduced Wastage: Accurate forecasting can help prevent stockouts and overstocking, reducing product wastage.
Enhanced Supply Chain Efficiency: Optimized warehouse supply will improve overall supply chain performance and customer satisfaction.
Future Directions:

Incorporate additional factors: Explore other relevant variables that might influence demand, such as marketing campaigns or economic indicators.
Real-time updates: Implement a system to continuously update the model with new data and adapt forecasts accordingly.
Sensitivity analysis: Analyze the impact of different parameters on model predictions to understand the robustness of the results.
